## About
This repository is part of an assignment for the class EDS-220 Environmental Datasets at University of California, Santa Barbara as part of the Master's of Environmental Data Science program with the Bren School for Environmental Science and Management. 

It contains code for analysis of biodiversity decline in the Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler Metropolitan Statistical District. By sourcing data for a Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII), we quantify change in an area's biodiversity on a temporal scale.
